# RECAST3D

REConstruction of Arbitrary Slices in Tomography

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicwi/RECAST3D/develop/docs/preview_usage.gif)

This project contains a full-stack implementation of a tomographic reconstruction and visualization pipeline.

RECAST3D is visualization software for tomographic imaging based on on-demand reconstruction of arbitrary slices, and is built for use in a distributed,
real-time, and online reconstruction pipeline.

The repository also contains two support libraries, *TomoPackets* and *SliceRecon*.

The TomoPackets library defines a protocol for sending messages between the different
components (scanners, reconstruction nodes, visualization workstations) for
real-time tomographic reconstruction and we encourage its use also outside of RECAST3D.

SliceRecon contains efficient implementations for reconstructing
arbitrarily oriented slices through a 3D volume. It defines servers that are
able to communicate to data sources (using TomoPackets) and visualization
software (such as, but not exclusively, RECAST3D).
