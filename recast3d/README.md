REConstruction of Arbitrary Slices in Tomography

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicwi/RECAST3D/develop/docs/preview_usage.gif)

This visualization software for tomography, is built for use in a distributed,
real-time live reconstruction pipeline. It uses [TomoPackets] as its protocol
for requesting and receiving slice reconstructions, and other data.

- [SliceRecon]

Dependencies
============

* `OpenGL` (required) development libraries and headers
* `glm` (required)
* `GLFW` (submodule)
* `Assimp` (submodule)
* `ImGui` (submodule)
* `ZeroMQ` (submodule)
* `cppzmq` (submodule)
* `Eigen` (submodule)
* `TomoPackets` (submodule)

Installation
============

Build RECAST3D:
---------------

After installing the dependencies, run:

```
git submodule update --remote --init --recursive
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j8
```

The RECAST3D binary can then be found in the `build` directory.
