# SliceRecon

A library for on-demand tomographic reconstructions of arbitrary slices.

This project contains efficient reconstruction code for reconstructing
arbitrarily oriented slices through a 3D volume. It defines servers that are
able to communicate to data sources (using [TomoPackets]) and visualization
software (such as [RECAST3D]).
